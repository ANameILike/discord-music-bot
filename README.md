Music bot for discord
---------------------
- Uses ! prefix
- Can currently only play certain songs from my music collection
- Commands:
    - help, hello
    - join, play [song name], play-album [album name], pause, resume, stop, leave
    - queue, shuffle, skip, remove [queue place], clear
    - playrandom [number]

Still very much a work in progress
